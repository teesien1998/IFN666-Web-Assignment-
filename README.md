# Application Architecture Description

The website is a portfolio platform built using React, a JavaScript library known for its efficient component-based architecture. It employs React functional components and hooks for managing state and side effects, enhancing the site's reactivity and performance.

For site navigation, React Router is used to facilitate seamless transitions between different pages. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, which provides utility-first classes that speed up the development process. The data for projects and blog posts are dynamically sourced from external APIs, including GitHub for projects and dev.to for blog content. This architecture not only ensures a modular and scalable application but also leverages modern web technologies for a robust user experience.
